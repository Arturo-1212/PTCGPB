# Hoytdj's Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket Bot
This bot is an extension (AKA fork) of [Arturo's PTCGP Bot](https://github.com/Arturo-1212/PTCGPB). _Thanks for all the hard work Arturo!_ After any new releases of the main bot, this bot will be updated as soon as possible.

### What features does this add?
A new "GP Test" mode has been added to the Main account script. When toggled on, the bot will automatically remove all non-VIP friends (i.e., friends that may have pulled a live GP). When all non-VIP friends have been removed, the bot will pause, giving you the opportunity to nagivate to Wonder Picks and look for God Packs. When you're ready to continue, simply toggle "GP Test" mode off.
VIP friends are specified in the `vip_ids.txt` file. List friend codes each on their own line.

**IMPORTANT:** Tesseract is required for this to work.
* Download/install Tesseract from here: [Tesseract Github Link](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) 
* For now, Tesseract **must** be installed under `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`

_A note from Arturo:_

_The bot will always be free and I will update it as long as this method is viable. I've spent many hours creating the PTCGPB, and if itâ€™s helped you complete your collection, consider buying me a coffee to keep me going and adding new features!_
