# The guide and common issues are outdated at the moment, but should still mostly get you there if you also read the release notes.

*The bot will always be free and I will update it as long as this method is viable. I've spent many hours creating the PTCGPB, and if itâ€™s helped you complete your collection, consider buying me a coffee to keep me going and adding new features!*
